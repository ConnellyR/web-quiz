The frequency of a wave is 7 Hz. It's wavelength is 88 m. What is the velocity of this wave? 616 m/s.
An object with a mass of 5 kg, was pushed with a force of 25 N. What is it's accaleration? 5m/s2
 W means work
d means distance.
W=Fd
An object is pulled to the right with a constant forece or 30 N. It was moved 21 m, how much work is being done?
