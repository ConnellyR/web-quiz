      <h1> Physics</h1> 
      <p id="p1"> f means frequency,v means velocity, λ means wavelength</p>
	 <p id="p2">what is the equation for the velocity of a wave?</p>
	 <p id="p3">v=fλ</p>
	 <img id="wave" src="groundswell-waves.jpg" alt="wave">
	 <p id ="p4">Practice:</p>
	 <p id="p5">The frequency of a wave is 7 Hz. It's wavelength is 88 m. What is the velocity of this wave? </p>
	 <p id="p6">616 m/s</p>
    	 
	 <p id="p7"> F means force, m means mass,a means accaleration</p>
	 <p id="p8"> What is the equation for force?</p>
	 <p id="p9">F=ma</p>
	 <p id="p10">Practice: An object with a mass of 5 kg, was pushed with a force of 25 N. What is it's accaleration?</p> 
	 <p id="p11">5m/s2</p>
	 <p id="p12"> W means work,d means distance </p>
	 <p id="p13">what is the equation for Work?</p>
	 <p id="p14">W=Fd</p>
	 <p id ="p15"> Practice:An object is pulled to the right with a constant forece or 30 N. It was moved 21 m, how much work is being done?</p>
